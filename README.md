# Java Homework Solutions – College Assignments

This repository contains my personal solutions to Java homework assignments  
from various courses at my college, such as Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, and Data Structures.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `bank/` – Banking system exercise (includes classes like `Account`, `ProAccount`, etc.)
- `tasks/` – Task dependency system using a topological sort approach
- `util/` – Utility packages or additional helpers if used

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Java SE
- Eclipse IDE
- Git & GitHub for version control

## 📌 Purpose

The main goal of these tasks is to practice:
- Object-Oriented Design
- Algorithmic thinking
- Working with graphs (e.g., task dependencies)
- Building clean and maintainable Java code

## 📄 Disclaimer

Exercise instructions and test files were provided by the college.  
All logic, code, and solutions were implemented independently by me,  
**Gilad Pinhasovich**, for personal academic learning and practice purposes.
